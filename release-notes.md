## About the release notes

We deliver F# and F# tools for Visual Studio and .NET Core releases. These can include bug fixes, new tooling features, new compiler features, performance improvements, infrastructure improvements, and new language versions. The most recent release of F# or any F# component will be at the top of this document.

## Visual Studio 15.9

You can find all tracked VS 15.9 items in the [15.9 milestone](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/milestone/24).

### F# Compiler

* Fix (#4637) - Can't debug FCS when compiled with portable pdb debug symbols, by [Jason Imison](https://github.com/nosami).
* Fix (#5355) - We fixed a bug where extension methods that take `byref` values could mutate an immutable value.
* Fix (#5446) - We improved the compile error information for overloads on `byref`/`inref`/`outref`, rather than displaying the previously obscure error.
* Fix (#5354) - Optional Type Extensions on `byref`s are now disallowed entirely. They could be declared previously, but were unusable, resulting in a confusing user experience.
* Fix (#5294) - We fixed a bug where `CompareTo` on a struct tuple and causing a type equivalence with an aliased struct tuple would result in a runtime exception.
* Fix (#5621) - We fixed a bug where use of `System.Void` in the context of authoring a Type Provider for .NET Standard could fail to find the `System.Void` type at design-time.
* Fix (#5468) - We fixed a bug where an internal error could occur when a partially applied Discriminated Union constructor is mismatched with an annotated or inferred type for the Discriminated Union.
* Fix (#5540) - We modified the compiler error message when attempting to take an address of an expression (such as accessing a property) to make it more clear that it violates scoping rules for `byref` types.
* Fix (#5536) - We fixed a bug where your program could crash at runtime when partially applying a `byref` type to a method or function. An error message will now display.
* Fix (#5459) - We fixed an issue where an invalid combination of a `byref` and a reference type (such as `byref<int> option`) would fail at runtime and not emit an error message. We now emit an error message.

### F# Tools for Visual Studio

* Fix (#5657) - We resolved an issue where metadata for F# assemblies built with the .NET Core SDK was not shown in file properties on Windows. You can now see this metadata by right-clicking an assembly on Windows and selecting **Properties**.
* Fix (#5615) - We fixed a bug where use of `module global` in F# source could cause Visual Studio to become unresponsive.
* Fix (#5515) - We fixed a bug where extension methods using `inref<'T>` would not show in completion lists.
* Fix (#5514) - We fixed a bug where the TargetFramework dropdown in Project Properties for .NET Framework F# projects was empty.
* Fix (#5507) - We fixed a bug where File | New Project on a .NET Framework 4.0 project would fail.

### F# OSS Build

* Feature (#5027) - Set VisualFSharpFull as the default startup project, by [Robert Jeppesen](https://github.com/rojepp).
    
## Visual Studio 15.8.5

* Fix (#5504) - Internal MSBuild Error when building non-.NET SDK projects with MSBuild parallelism
* Fix (#5518) - Visual Studio-deployed components are not NGEN'd
* Fix ([Devcom 322883](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/322883/all-net-framework-f-projects-build-to-4500-regardl.html)) - FSharp.Core 4.5.0.0 binary is deployed to FSharp.Core 4.4.3.0 location

All other closed issues for the VS 15.8 release can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/milestone/14).

## F# 4.5

We introduced the F# language version 4.5 with this release. This also corresponds with the new 4.5.x family of FSharp.Core (the F# core library). You can read the specs for each of these changes in the [F# RFC repository](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-design). There are also many improvements to F# tools for Visual Studio with this release.

### Releases

* Visual Studio 2017 update 15.8
* .NET Core SDK version 2.1.400 or higher

### Language features

* Support for `voidptr`
* `NativePtr.ofVoidPtr` and `NativePtr.toVoidPtr` support
* New types: `inref<'T>`, `outref<'T>` to represent read-only and write-only `byref`s
* Support for `IsByRefLike` structs
* Support for `IsReadOnly` structs
* Full support for production and consumption of `byref` returns
* Support for extension methods for `byref`/`inref`/`outref`
* Support for `match!` in computation expressions
* Relaxed upcast requirements for `yield` in sequence, list, and array expressions
* Relaxed indentation requirements for list and array expressions
* Enumeration cases emitted as public
* Various bug fixes with `byref` programming

### FSharp.Core features

* Version aligned to 4.5.x for the NuGet package and 4.5.0.0 for the binary
* Improved strack traces for `async { }` so that user code can now be seen
* Support for `ValueOption<'T>`
* Support for `TryGetValue` on Map

### Compiler improvements

Improvements to the F# compiler in addition to the previously-mentioned language features are in F# 4.5. These include:

* Restored ability to inherit from `FSharpFunc`
* Removed ~2.2% of all allocations in the F# compiler
* F# reference normalization support for user control of transitive assembly references written to an output file
* Respecting `WarningsNotAsErrors`
* Error message improvement when branches of a pattern match do not return the same type
* Respecting `#nowarn "2003"`
* Other smaller performance improvements and many bug fixes

### Tooling improvements

Significant improvements in the F# tools, such as performance enhancements and some new editor features are included this release. As always, with a large number of contributions from the F# open source community. Here are the highlights:

* We improved IntelliSense performance for .NET SDK-style projects of all forms, including those that use multi-targeting.
* A community-driven effort to analyze and improve IntelliSense performance for very large files was contributed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko),[ Steffen Forkmann](https://github.com/forki), and [Gauthier Segay](https://github.com/smoothdeveloper). IntelliSense in very large files (10k+ lines of code) is roughly twice as fast now.
* The warning for an outdated FSharp.Core (despite the package being installed) is no longer present in .NET SDK-style projects.
* The description tooltip that displays XML documentation for a member after . in IntelliSense no longer times out after 10 seconds.
* A bug where you could not set breakpoints in object constructor arguments has been fixed.
* A bug where a renamed symbol would be duplicated when it is a generic parameter has been fixed.
* Templates for .NET Framework (classic F# templates) now consume FSharp.Core from a NuGet package, to align with .NET SDK F# templates.
* Automatic, transactional brace completion is now available for `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `[||]`, and `[<>]` brace pairs. We did this work in collaboration with [Gibran Rosa](https://github.com/gibranrosa).
* You can now go to definition with **Ctrl + Click** on an F# symbol. The settings for this gesture are also respected in the **Tools > Options** window.
* The IntelliSense performance UI has been modified to allow configuration of stale typecheck information for various IDE features. Explanations for each option are now present in tooltips for the settings.
* Brace match highlighting now correctly highlights braces, completed in collaboration with [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* Go to definition now navigates correctly when a type is defined recursively, contributed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where an auto-imported namespace wasn't opened when the top of a file was empty has been fixed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where `printf` specifiers that contained dots were miscolored has been fixed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where all opens were considered unused inside of a recursive module has been fixed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* Autocompletion for attributes now only suggests options that are actually attributes, contributed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* Signature Help tooltips are now generated for Type Provider static parameters at the constructor call site, contributed by[Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where value types used as units of measure were colored as reference types has been fixed by [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
* A bug where semantic colorization could disappear for some files while scrolling has been fixed by  [Vasily Kirichenko](https://github.com/vasily-kirichenko).
There is now an experimental CodeLens implementation, contributed by [Victor Peter Rouven MÃ¼ller](https://github.com/realvictorprm). You can turn it on in **Options > Text Editor > F# > Code Lens**.
* A bug where the F# compiler service would incorrectly elide the module names in XML documentation has been fixed by [Sebastian Urban](https://github.com/surban).
* Code that uses `Dictionary` with `ContainsKey` and subsequent `Item` calls has been changed to use `TryGetValue`, by [Eugene Auduchinok](https://github.com/auduchinok).
* [Jakob Majoka](https://github.com/majocha) also contributed in the process of consuming a different API for Tooltips.

### Infrastructure, Packaging, and Open Source Improvements

We made the following enhancements to infrastructure, packaging, and our open source contribution experience:

* The F# compiler distributed with Visual Studio no longer installs as a singleton in the F# Compiler SDK location. It is now fully side-by-side with Visual Studio, meaning that side-by-side installations of Visual Studio wil finally have truly side-by-side F# tooling and language experiences.
* The FSharp.Core NuGet package is now signed.
* ETW logging has been added to the F# tools and compiler.
* The very large `control.fs`/`control.fsi` files in FSharp.Core have been split into `async.fs`/`async.fsi`, `event.fs`/`event.fsi`, `eventmodule.fs`/`eventmodule.fsi`, `mailbox.fs`/`mailbox.fsi`, and `observable.fs`/`observable.fsi`.
* We added .NET SDK-style versions of our project performance stress test artifacts.
* We removed Newtonsoft.json from our codebase, and you now have one less package downloaded for OSS contributors.
* We now use the latest versions of System.Collections.Immutable and System.Reflection.Metadata.
